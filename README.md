# RuVi
The Rust Vi :)

## but why?
bc I got bored and wanted to make a TUI text editor in less than 12 hours

## Usage
`ruvi [filename]`

`filename` can point to a new or existing file.

You can write the file with `<ESC>w<CR>` and quit RuVi with `<ESC>q<CR>`

To enter Insert mode, press `i`. To exit Insert mode, press `<ESC>`.
